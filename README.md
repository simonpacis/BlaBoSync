# BlaBoSync 

My university uses Blackboard to share files, discussions etc.
The idea behind BlaBoSync is to scrape the website and download all material for the courses (which are always uploaded as .docx or .pdf) locally, and then when run again, if a file has changed remotely, replace the local file with the new version from Blackboard.
