# BlaBoTool 
My university uses Blackboard to share files, discussions etc.
As I spend 90% of my time in the CLI, I had an idea for a CLI Blackboard tool.
The idea behind BlaBoTool is to be able to control and use different aspects of Blackboard through CLI.
For now, only BlaBoSync exists, which automatically downloads course material to your local computer.

## Installation
Download the following requirements using pip: selenium, markdownify, requests, beautifulsoup4, rich

### Installing selenium
Follow these directions to make sure Selenium is installed correctly.
BlaBoSync uses the chromedriver.

Run python3 tool.py, and BlaBoTool will guide you through the setup process.
